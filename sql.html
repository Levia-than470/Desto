    <h1>SQL Injection Explained</h1>

    <h2>1. Basic SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>
        Basic SQL injection occurs when user input is directly included in a SQL query without proper sanitization. 
        Attackers can manipulate the input to modify the SQL query and access unauthorized data. 
        This type of attack is often used to bypass login forms or retrieve sensitive information from the database.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Payload: <span class="payload">admin' OR 1=1 --</span></h3>
    <p>
        This payload uses the logical condition <code>OR 1=1</code>, which always evaluates to true. 
        It bypasses authentication checks, allowing the attacker to log in without a valid password. 
        The <code>--</code> comment symbol ignores the rest of the SQL query.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Union-Based SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>
        Union-based SQL injection uses the <code>UNION</code> operator to combine the results of two or more SQL queries. 
        Attackers can use this technique to extract data from different tables in the database. 
        It is often used when the application displays query results directly on the webpage.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Payload: <span class="payload">test' UNION SELECT null, sqlite_version(), null --</span></h3>
    <p>
        This payload uses the <code>UNION</code> operator to append a query that retrieves the database version. 
        The <code>null</code> values are used to match the number of columns in the original query. 
        This technique can reveal valuable information about the database, such as its version or structure.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Error-Based SQL Injection</h2>
    <p>
        Error-based SQL injection relies on triggering errors in the database to extract information. 
        The error messages returned by the database can disclose details about the database schema or its contents. 
        This technique is useful when the application returns detailed error messages in the response.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Payload: <span class="payload">info' UNION SELECT null, name, null FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' --</span></h3>
    <p>
        This payload attempts to extract table names from the <code>sqlite_master</code> system table. 
        If the application is vulnerable, the error message may include the names of tables in the database. 
        Attackers use this information to understand the database structure for further exploitation.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Extracting User Credentials</h2>
    <p>
        A common goal of SQL injection attacks is to extract user credentials from the database. 
        Attackers can use <code>UNION</code> queries or logical conditions to retrieve usernames and passwords. 
        This type of attack can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Payload: <span class="payload">users' UNION SELECT id, username, email FROM users --</span></h3>
    <p>
        This payload retrieves all user credentials from the <code>users</code> table using a <code>UNION</code> query. 
        It appends a query that selects the <code>id</code>, <code>username</code>, and <code>email</code> columns from the users table. 
        If successful, it displays the list of users and their contact information.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        SQL injection is a powerful attack technique that can compromise the security of a web application. 
        It is crucial to use parameterized queries and input validation to prevent these vulnerabilities. 
        By understanding these types of SQL injection, developers can better protect their applications against potential attacks.
